		<h3>Hello!!!</h3>
		<p id="p1">
			My name is Yosief Weldegebriel. I am orignally from Eritrea. I have a bachelors degree in Civil Engineering and Theology.I love coding and this cost me to leave the 5 year study of udergraduate class and join the coding community.

			While i was taking undergrad courses in Engineering, the programing language class was my favorite one. I really enjoy working with <span id="for">fortran</span> language(the oldest programing language). Then was the time that I found myself. Before  I join the UC Berkeley bootcamp, I have taken some online courses from udemy. I have also tried to study java by my own.The main purpose I join the bootcamp is to make network with folks and put myself on structured curriclum.
		</p>
		<p>
			I like challenges. I have tried to solve many challenges using Java the past three four months on my own.My future dream is to contribute something valueable application to the community.
